Analysis Tools for Water Pipelines

- This repo contains foundational tools for water pipeline economic modeling.

The natural [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle) of evaporation of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow is being disrupted by climactic change.  This change necessitates engineered solutions to preserve ecological biosystems that support natural processes such as salmon migration and also preserve human bio-economic activities such as agriculture and domestic water use.
